  If loving charts is wrong, I donâ€™t want to be right.
  Instead, I want to express my interest in your Graphics Reporting role, so that I may turn my passion for visual storytelling into a profession.
  More importantly, I will illustrate how I can help bridge the gap between The Washington Post and its mission to connect people to the information they need most.

  This is due to my strong visualization skill set, which I developed through both internships and conducting research.

  During my Informatics undergraduate at the University of Iowa, I have developed many of the skills you are seeking; including creating visualizations to tell an array of messages, learning about and applying best practices, and collaborating with experts to explore solutions.

  From classroom to career, I have a track record of distinguishing signal from noise.
  My senior year I enrolled in a Networking class, and investigated political tweets during the 2016 Presidential election.
  My work uncovered a network of fake accounts from over 1 TB of data, who were systematically pushing propaganda.

  Thank you for your time and consideration, I will follow up by email in one weeks time.
  I look forward to discussing your Graphics Reporter role further.
