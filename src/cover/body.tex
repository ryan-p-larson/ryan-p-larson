  % Introduction
  If loving charts is wrong, I donâ€™t want to be right.
  Instead, I want to express my interest in your Graphics Reporting role, so that I may turn my passion for visual storytelling into a profession.
  More importantly, I will illustrate how I can help bridge the gap between The Washington Post and its mission to connect the public to the truth.


  % Who are you; and why it matters
  I am an experienced practioner and data wrangler with a unique breadth of experience and capability for charts.
  During my Informatics undergraduate at the University of Iowa, I developed many of the skills you are seeking; including making maps, applying best practices within a student newsroom, and collaborating with experts to explore narratives.
  % TODO
  I took this focus into a professor .
  After publishing our findings I moved onto freelancing for the latest startup, where I've been for the last two years.

  That doesn't excite me nearly as much as what your graphics team does, however.

  I strongly believe in a  press.
  And considering the political climate we need unbiased Now more than ever.
  Charts can decieve just as much as words, and newsrooms need integrity now more than ever.

  I strongly believe in what The Post is doing, and I want to help your readers understand
  The position with The Post is a perfect blend of my technical skills, curiousity, and values.

  Thank you for your time and consideration, I will follow up by email in one weeks time.
  I look forward to discussing your Graphics Reporter role further.
